# What Have I Done?

 My first significant project started around 2001 when I designed and developped a large scale Windows application in Java for monitoring the network. I continued with the specifications of this software as the development was moved offsite. The software is still in use today by major telecommunication companies for optimizing their customer networks.
 
 My latest significant project started in 2017 in React.js, CSS, and JavaScript working closely with the Backend Developpers and communicating through a REST API. Today, this software is around 60,000 lines of code. This application is for browsing and filtering a large set of telecommunication database records.
