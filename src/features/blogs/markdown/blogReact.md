Hi! First of all, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, also known as ReactJS.  It brings the ability to create efficient, fast, optimized web applications whether in a large browser or on a mobile phone browser.

### React on This Website
This website you are on is written in React. This means:
* **Performance**: Updates to the pages are made only when needed; i.e. no performance issues because of extra refreshing.
* **Organization**: The different parts of the website are divided into components: menubar, version history, each page like the Projects, Blogs, Contact, About, Home.
* **Behavior**: React style event handlers (mouse clicks, entering, leaving, animation) are used.
* **Application Setup**: The application was first created using Create React App and then modified.  Create React App creates a starting application template with all the minimum need to have a React application ready to be used including libraries, building, packaging, testing.
* **Links to Pages**: The pages that are opened when clicking on the menu bar have a new url path but not are part of a new html file.  This is thanks tof React Router.
* **Markdown File Loading**: The *loading* of the Markdown files uses [window.fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) at the proper time in React. See [AJAX and APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)
* **Markdown to React Conversion**: An external library is used to convert the formatting to the formatting used in React Components.


### Not React on This Website
Parts of this website that do not have anything in particular to do with React:
* **Responsive UI Changes**: The changes in the fonts, the menu, are not because of React but thanks to CSS rules.
* **Font Style**: The fonts are imported in the HTML and declared in the CSS.
* **HTML Objects**: No user interface components are delivered in React.  *All* the *objects* seen are made from HTML and styled using CSS: menubar, menu page, headers, lists, separate pages, links to external pages like LinkedIn, version history.
* **Images**: The images are mostly from Unsplash and embedded using HTML with CSS for the positioning.
