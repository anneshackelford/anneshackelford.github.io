Hi! Let's talk about Markdown Documentation.  Never heard of it?  Well, it is an easily formatted document mostly by just using # to get the heading level you want and * to get bullets.  Hyperlinks can be added as well and many others.  But to get the basics, it's quick and easy.

This website you are on is using markdown documentation for the blogs, like this one you are reading.  The blog is written in markdown and then automatically formatted as designed on the webpage in a separate blog.  It is easy to convert markdown to HTML thus easy to display here.
